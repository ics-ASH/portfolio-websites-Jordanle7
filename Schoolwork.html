                <p>Article: <a href="https://computer.howstuffworks.com/pc.htm">https://computer.howstuffworks.com/pc.htm</a></p>
                <p>Paragraph By: Jordan Le And Jerry Lin</p>
                <p><strong>What Is a PC?</strong></p>
                <p>A computer is an object that can be given an input and create an output, similarly the brain can be considered a computer as well, and scientists continue to discover more impressive features of the brain and how it works. But in most cases the word “Computer” is to talk about an “electronic device containing a microprocessor”.</p>
                <p>What is a Microprocessor? A Microprocessor is a small electronic device that can process any data given instantaneously. They can be commonly found in day to day devices such as PCs, Vehicles, TVs, Phones, etc.</p>
                <p>PC’s were officially stamped as a sought after home appliance after the Apple II was created, although the Altair 8800 was the first “Personal Computer”. The Apple II proved that there could be a demand for personal computers because they could be used in homes and at school.</p>
                <p>PCs must include these parts to function:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Motherboards</li>
                    <li>Power Supplies</li>
                    <li>CPUs</li>
                    <li>Ram</li>
                    <li>Drives</li>
                    <li>Cooling</li>
                    <li>Cables</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All of these components work together in order to make a PC fully functional in order to actually give it inputs and receive outputs.</p>
                <p><strong>Powering up a PC</strong></p>
                <p>When you first press the power button on the case of the PC several internal processes start before you can use your PC, this is called the “Boot Process”. During this process, the power button starts your power supply giving your entire PC power. This process is controlled by your basic input output system or “BIOS” for short and stored on a flash memory chip but in a pc It’s embedded on the motherboard. The Bios also provides a basic menu to check things like drives during the boot process.</p>

                <p><strong>Week 2</strong></p>
                <p>Article: <a href="https://www.crucial.com/articles/pc-builders/what-is-computer-hardware">https://www.crucial.com/articles/pc-builders/what-is-computer-hardware</a></p>
                <p><strong>Computer Hardware:</strong></p>
                <p>What is computer hardware? Computer hardware, simply means “any physical parts of components that contribute to a computer system”. There are many different types of computer hardware inside both Desktop PC’s and Laptop PC’s (Laptop hardware is generally smaller so it can fit in a compact design).</p>
                <p><strong>Different Between “Software” and “Hardware”:</strong></p>
                <p>Hardware is something you are able to physically touch and put together in order for a computer to work, and function(Inputs and outputs). To be considered hardware it must be tangible and for example, be screwed into a PC case.</p>
                <p>Software: Software, similarly, is something that pretty much makes a PC do what it can do, but it is NOT physical, so you cannot actually touch it, but it could be programs that you install on your PC to create more practicality. It could be defined as “A set of instructions to tell you're PC how to work”.</p>
                <p><strong>Different types of Hardwares</strong></p>
                <p>Motherboards are the hub of your computer. It connects to all the other pieces of hardware and allows them to function by sending and controlling how much power is getting sent to each hardware for them to properly operate.</p>
                <p>The Central processing unit or CPU is your processing power for running your computer. It’s the brain of the computer, It’s responsible for processing the data your computer needs to process and operate.</p>

                <p><strong>Week 3</strong></p>
                <p>Article: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity">https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity</a></p>
                <p><strong>What is a cyber attack?</strong></p>
                <p>Cyber Attackers have opportunities to disrupt, damage, and even destroy businesses, and every single day the cost to restore damages keeps rising year after year. According to IBM’s data, a data breach can cause businesses to spend up to 4.45 million USD, which is 15% higher than it was in the past 3 years. Certain specific attacks, such as ransomware-related issues(Ransomware is a type of malicious software that is designed to block access to a computer system until money is paid to the attacker) can cost up to 5.13 million USD, this amount of money does not include the amount that is required to pay for the ransom as well. 5.13 million USD is 89% higher than the amount in previous years.</p>
                <p><strong>What is cyber security?</strong></p>
                <p>Cyber Security is any technology that has the ability to prevent and mitigate cyber-attacks. Cyber security protects you from losing all of your files and data to a computer virus or a ransomware attack.</p>
                <p><strong>Why is cyber security important?</strong></p>
                <p>Cyber security is important to prevent people from illegally accessing information that could cause damage to businesses, the government, etc. Cyber Security is also important even if you have a small business as 37% of ransomware was sent to companies with less than 100 employees in 2021, no matter how small your business is you’re never safe from cyber attacks.</p>

                <p><strong>Week 4</strong></p>
                <p>Article: <a href="#">Robotics - Link</a></p>
                <p><strong>Components of a robot:</strong></p>
                <p>The control system is all the components that make up the robot's central processing unit. It’s programmed to tell the robot how to utilize specific components just like the human brain. Sensors provide the robot with electrical signals that are processed by the and allow the robot to interact with the outside world. Common sensors include video cameras, photoresistors, and microphones, this allows the robot to process information about its surroundings and utilize it to make decisions. Actuators are responsible for giving the robot its ability to move its limbs around. They receive the electrical signals from the robot’s central processing unit and move to carry out the necessary actions. The robot also needs a power source to function which is most commonly a lead acid battery for its safe qualities and long shelf life, but there are also the more expensive silver cadmium batteries that can be used. End effectors are the tools the robot needs in order to perform its job. They can be screwdriver heads, paintbrushes, or even a claw.</p>
                <p><strong>What is Robotics:</strong></p>
                <p>Robotics is the injection of science, engineering, and technology that contribute to the production of certain machines, known as robots. They replicate or substitute human actions, and can perform basic and repetitive tasks with a greater efficiency and accuracy than humans, which makes them the ideal tool for industries such as manufacturing. However, the introduction of artificial intelligence in robotics has given robots the ability to handle more and more complex situations in various industries as well.</p>
                <p><strong>What is a Robot:</strong></p>
                <p>A robot is a programmable machine that can complete a specific task. The term robotics describes the field of study in which describes the development of a robot, or automation. Each robot has a different level of autonomy (how automatic it is) and there are level ranges on how much a human will need to interact with it to function.</p>

                <p>Article: <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/small-business/resource-center/networking/networking-basics.html">https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/small-business/resource-center/networking/networking-basics.html</a></p>
                <p><strong>Networking Basics</strong></p>
                <p>A computer network is a group of computers connected together to share resources and information. Networks can range from a small local area network (LAN) to large wide area networks (WAN) that span cities or even countries.</p>
                <p><strong>Types of Networks:</strong></p>
                <p>There are several types of networks, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>LAN (Local Area Network): Covers a small geographic area, like a home, school, or office building.</li>
                    <li>WAN (Wide Area Network): Covers a large geographic area, such as a city, country, or even global connections.</li>
                    <li>MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): Spans a city or a large campus.</li>
                    <li>PAN (Personal Area Network): Covers a very small area, typically a few meters, such as Bluetooth connections.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Network Topologies:</strong></p>
                <p>The arrangement of a network, including its nodes and connecting lines, is called its topology. Common network topologies include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bus Topology: All devices are connected to a single central cable, called the bus or backbone.</li>
                    <li>Star Topology: All devices are connected to a central hub. If the hub fails, the whole network is inoperable.</li>
                    <li>Ring Topology: Each device is connected to two other devices, forming a ring for signals to travel.</li>
                    <li>Mesh Topology: Devices are interconnected, with multiple pathways for data to travel.</li>
                </ul>
