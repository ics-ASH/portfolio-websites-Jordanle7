            <!-- about me text goes here -->
             My name is Jordan Le, I am 16 years old born the 16th of february, 2008. I was born and raised in Canada and I enjoy many things.
             The reason I picked this course is primarily to see how much I really enjoy the computer field, and the different changes it can bring to the world as we know it.
