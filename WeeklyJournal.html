            Week 1: Feb 5 - Feb 9

            On the first week we did the typical introduction stuff, where we get all settled in, we also had a presentation about nokia and watched a movie, that I unfortunately missed most of due to being sick.


            Week 2: Feb 12 - Feb 16

            Nothing really special happened, we spent this week setting up our laptops with Visual Studio Code and creating accounts on platforms like GitHub and CMU. We also started up these wonderful websites.


            Week 3: Feb 19 - Feb 23

            we had our first Tech Tuesday and started learning binary on Khan Academy. We were introduced to CSE using Raspberry Pi, practiced typing with Typing Club, and continued our binary lessons. The lesson for binary was EXTENSIVE.


            Week 4: Feb 26 - Mar 1

            We focused on binary at Khan Academy and had our second Tech Tuesday. We also did some CSE and did a quiz/got our quiz results back.


            Week 5: Mar 4 - Mar 8
            
            We went a little more into detail on other tech related topics, doing the usual tech tuesday and CSE, we started learning more about python and also got to have a day to play some minecraft.

            
            Week 6: Mar 11 - Mar 15

            This week was the break, but ain't no slackin, so I did SLIGHT work only.


            Week 7: Mar 18 - Mar 22

            We updated our websites and focused on AI, learning about its applications and implications. In CSE, we started lighting up Unicorn Hats with simple programs, gradually increasing their complexity. We also learned HTML to create and format websites, and learned more to advance our sites more.


            Week 8: Mar 25 - Mar 29

            ALOT of codehs


            Week 9: Apr 1 - Apr 5

            After Easter Monday, we continued updating our websites and enhancing our CSE skills. We started our Unit 1 CMU Academy final task, creating scenes and drawing shapes. I made a walmart..


            Week 10: Apr 8 - Apr 12

            SHORT WEEK, In CSE, we used for loops to create changing lights with the Unicorn Hat. We continued with CMU, getting through Units 1 and 2, and I learned a lot about functions and events, which inspired my next unit task.


            Week 11: Apr 15 - Apr 19

            Cmu, CSE, more and more.


            Week 12: Apr 22 - Apr 26

            We continued with CMU, creating projects with more advanced shapes. Harder and harder each day. But learning a lot more.


            Week 13: Apr 29 - May 3

            This week, we finished our hardware projects, building custom computers based on chosen professions. I created a insane computer that costed roughly 40 thousand dollars. Also had to work on the poster.


            Week 14: May 6 - May 10

            We wrapped up our hardware posters and projects, then started programming K8 robots using MicroBit. The k8 was annoying to setup but it was pretty cool once we finished it all up.


            Week 15: May 13 - May 17

            We continued enhancing our K8 robots, making them remote-controlled and decorating them. Ours had control issues and was inverted, but still pretty cool.

            
            Week 16: May 20 - May 24

            Shorter week AGAIN, we had our final CSE days, where I was sick yet again. But after that we worked on the k8s more preparing for the battle.


            Week 17: May 27 - May 31

            This week was the battle royale, but I missed it unfortunately. I had a fieldtrip AND a tournament, very sad.


            Week 18: Jun 3 - Jun 7

            The focus returned to AI, studying large language models and prompt specialization through CodeHS. We ended the week by starting our AI detectives project and preparing presentations.


            Week 19: Jun 10 - Jun 14

            Done with the presentation, pretty light work. Added more stuff and worked on some more code HS


            The Finale

            Wrapping the year up nicely, hope it is light before exams start.
